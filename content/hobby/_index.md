A few things I enjoy outside research.

## Anime 🎬

  I’ve always been a big fan of Japanese anime. Some of my favorite shows include <em>Attack on Titan</em> and <em>Madoka Magica</em>, and my favorite character is Arima Kana from <em>Oshi no Ko</em>. I really enjoy discussing anime with others, so feel free to chat with me about it anytime.

I also enjoy going to Japanese karaoke and was a member of the NTU Japanese Song Club.
If you have similar interests, we can go sing together sometime!

By the way, I love attending concerts, and I’ve made it to several shows over the past few years.

## Board Games and Social games🎲

I love various types of board games! Recently I especially enjoy <a href="https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Main_Page" target="_blank">BOTC</a>.
If you also love board games, we can hang out and play together!

## Drawing ✏️

I like drawing from time to time — I’m still learning, but it’s fun.
Maybe I’ll share some of my sketches someday.

---

## Sports 🏃

I don’t exercise very often, but it feels fun when I do.
I enjoy jogging, cycling, and hiking, and I’d be happy to join if someone invites me.

## Some other hobbies I want to explore

I’d also like to spend more time on cooking, piano, japanese mahjang, chess, and reading, though I never seem to have enough time for them.
Still, if you enjoy any of these too, we can always try doing them together!
