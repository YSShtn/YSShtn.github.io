        I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and combinatorics, especially on graph-theoretic problems.
        
        I enjoy learning through seminars, reading groups, and collaborations.
        It is always pleased to meet more talented people in this area, explore new ideas together, and help bring new members into this community.
