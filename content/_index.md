        I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and combinatorics.

        Currently, I work on topics including:

        - Graph algorithms and coloring of 3-colorable graphs  
        - Extremal and probabilistic combinatorics  
        - Streaming and sublinear algorithms  

        I enjoy learning from seminars, reading groups, and collaborations.
