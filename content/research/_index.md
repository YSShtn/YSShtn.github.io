        I focus on graph algorithms, extremal and probabilistic combinatorics,
        streaming / sublinear algorithms, and complexity lower bounds.

        - **Polynomial coloring of 3-colorable graphs** (ongoing)
          - *Collaborator*: Prof. Shang-En Huang
          - Coloring 3-colorable graphs is a classic problem. I aim to make a reduction from general settings to restricted cases and to develop algorithms for specific classes of graphs.
        - **Upper and Lower Bounds for Subgraph Detection in the Streaming Model** (ongoing; planned submission to CCC)
          - *Collaborators*: Ying-Sien Wu, Yen-Chu Tsai, Prof. Meng-Tsung Tsai
          - We establish tight space-complexity bounds for several classes of subgraph detection problems, and explore connections between streaming algorithms and extremal graph theory.
